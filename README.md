# Calculator
Simple calculator using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT
Calculator Description
This project showcases a simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. The calculator features a clean and intuitive user interface with responsive button interactions, allowing users to perform calculations seamlessly.

Features:
User Interface:

Display Area: Shows the current input or result of the calculation. The display is an input field styled for readability and set to be non-editable directly, ensuring interaction through the buttons only.
Button Layout: Organized in a grid, the buttons are arranged for easy access, including digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, รท), a decimal point, a clear button (C), and an equals button (=).
Design:

The calculator has a modern, minimalistic design with a light background and distinct color schemes for numbers, operators, and the equals button.
Hover Effects: Buttons change color on hover, providing visual feedback to the user.
Functionality:

Event Handling: JavaScript event listeners capture button clicks, allowing users to input numbers and select operations.
Arithmetic Operations: Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator processes these operations in sequence, updating the display with results.
Clear Function: The clear button resets the display and internal state, allowing users to start a new calculation.
Logic:

Number Input: As users click number buttons, the display updates to show the current number being entered.
Operator Management: The script handles arithmetic operations by storing the first operand and the selected operator. It waits for the second operand before performing the calculation when the equals button is pressed.
Result Calculation: Once the equals button is clicked, the calculator evaluates the expression based on the chosen operator and operands, displaying the result.
Purpose:
This calculator project serves as a practical example of integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive web application. It demonstrates fundamental web development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling, making it an excellent addition to a personal portfolio or educational resource.
